# Hi, I'm Rui

Usually interacting with atoms, but here to dive into the world of bits.
I'm a researcher working at the intersection of **biology, computation, and entrepreneurship**.  
My work spans **honeybee nutrition & health**, **protein engineering**, and **data-driven experimental design**, with applications in agriculture, biotech, and sustainability.
